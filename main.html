	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		I've always been fascinated by how technology works, and the idea of building something that can solve real-world problems excites me. Becoming a developer allows me to create useful applications, think logically, and continuously learn new skills in a fast-evolving field.
